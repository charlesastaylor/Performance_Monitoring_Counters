Jai module to enable collecting Performance-Monitoring Counters (PMCs) thread-safe, continuously on a running program.

Inspired (and significantly aided!) by ["The Computer Enhance 2024 International Event Tracing for Windows Halloween
Spooktacular Challenge"](https://www.computerenhance.com/p/announcing-the-etw-halloween-spooktacular).

Includes bindings to the Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) api in the Windows_Event_Tracing module, with examples ported from mmozeiko's gists [etw](https://gist.github.com/mmozeiko/299fc8ff993b9c671eb7fd5c7bd87d51) and [miniperf](https://gist.github.com/mmozeiko/bd5923bcd9d20b5b9946691932ec95fa?ts=4).

A pretty silly example of collecting pmcs per frame and changing the active pmcs - https://youtu.be/ZCFkBtRG2Lg.
